        <img class="selfshot" src="assets/images/ProfilePic.JPG" alt="A photo of me"/>
        <p>I'm an Energetic administrative and operational professional, customer service champion, and Excel guru. I have multi-field experience supporting service and production teams.  I excel at delivering innovative thinking that improves net revenue for the teams I support. My passion is process streamlining! (Seriously.) My most recent projects have resulted in improved real-time labor tracking and project component consolidation.  My diverse experience has led me to a career in office and team management, and has provided me the opportunities to optimize operations, satisfy clients, and provide a healthy environment for my employees.</p>
        <p>  I'm currently enrolled in the University of California's Remote Software Development Program.  This program is teaching me the ability to develop front-end, back-end, and everything in between to ensure an ability to develop and maintain fully integrated software.</p>
        <p>  During the multitude of time off that I have, I like to kayak, hike, and rock climb.  I'm a huge Mariners and Seahawks fan, and devour history books.</pr>
          <p>I'm a wine enthusiast, news junkie, and another one of my favorite hobbies includes spoiling my neices and nephews.</p>
